## 题目

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you can:

Choose an index i in the range 0 <= i < nums.length
Set nums[i] to nums[i] + 1 or nums[i] - 1

Return the minimum number of operations to make nums non-decreasing or non-increasing.

**Example 1**：

**Input**：nums = [3,2,4,5,0]
**Output**：4
**Explanation**：
One possible way to turn nums into non-increasing order is to:
- Add 1 to nums[1] once so that it becomes 3.
- Subtract 1 from nums[2] once so it becomes 3.
- Subtract 1 from nums[3] twice so it becomes 3.
After doing the 4 operations, nums becomes [3,3,3,3,0] which is in non-increasing order.
Note that it is also possible to turn nums into [4,4,4,4,0] in 4 operations.
It can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of operations needed.

**Example 2**：

**Input**：nums = [2,2,3,4]
**Output**：0
**Explanation**：nums is already in non-decreasing order, so no operations are needed and we return 0.

**Example 3**：

**Input**：nums = [0]
**Output**：0
**Explanation**：nums is already in non-decreasing order, so no operations are needed and we return 0.


**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(nums)$ $\le 1000$
0 <= nums[i] $\le 1000$
