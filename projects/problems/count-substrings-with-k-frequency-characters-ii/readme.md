## 题目

Given a string s and an integer k, return the total number of substrings of s where at least one character appears at least k times.

**Example 1**：

**Input**：s = "abacb", k = 2
**Output**：4
**Explanation**：
The valid substrings are:

"aba" (character 'a' appears 2 times).
"abac" (character 'a' appears 2 times).
"abacb" (character 'a' appears 2 times).
"bacb" (character 'b' appears 2 times).


**Example 2**：

**Input**：s = "abcde", k = 1
**Output**：15
**Explanation**：
All substrings are valid because every character appears at least once.


**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(s)$ $\le 3$ * 105
1 <= k $\le \mathrm{len}(s)$
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
