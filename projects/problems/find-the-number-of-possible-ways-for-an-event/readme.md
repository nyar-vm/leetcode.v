## 题目

You are given three integers n, x, and y.
An event is being held for n performers. When a performer arrives, they are assigned to one of the x stages. All performers assigned to the same stage will perform together as a band, though some stages might remain empty.
After all performances are completed, the jury will award each band a score in the range [1, y].
Return the total number of possible ways the event can take place.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Note that two events are considered to have been held differently if either of the following conditions is satisfied:

Any performer is assigned a different stage.
Any band is awarded a different score.


**Example 1**：

**Input**：n = 1, x = 2, y = 3
**Output**：6
**Explanation**：

There are 2 ways to assign a stage to the performer.
The jury can award a score of either 1, 2, or 3 to the only band.


**Example 2**：

**Input**：n = 5, x = 2, y = 1
**Output**：32
**Explanation**：

Each performer will be assigned either stage 1 or stage 2.
All bands will be awarded a score of 1.


**Example 3**：

**Input**：n = 3, x = 3, y = 4
**Output**：684


**Constraints**：

1 <= n, x, y $\le 1000$
