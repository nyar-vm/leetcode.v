## 题目

A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.\r
\r
The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.\r
\r
Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.\r
\r
\r
**Example 1**：\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
**Input**：distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1\r
**Output**：1\r
**Explanation**：Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.\r
\r
\r
\r
**Example 2**：\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
**Input**：distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2\r
**Output**：3\r
**Explanation**：Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
**Example 3**：\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
**Input**：distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 3\r
**Output**：4\r
**Explanation**：Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.\r
\r
\r
\r
**Constraints**：\r
\r
\r
1 <= n <= $10^{4}$\r
distance.length == n\r
0 <= start, destination < n\r
0 <= distance[i] <= $10^{4}$\r
