## 题目

Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is return any permutation p of (0,1,2.....,2^n -1) such that :\r
\r
\r
p[0] = start\r
p[i] and p[i+1] differ by only one bit in their binary representation.\r
p[0] and p[2^n -1] must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.\r
\r
\r
\r
**Example 1**：\r
\r
\r
**Input**：n = 2, start = 3\r
**Output**：[3,2,0,1]\r
**Explanation**：The binary representation of the permutation is (11,10,00,01). \r
All the adjacent element differ by one bit. Another valid permutation is [3,1,0,2]\r
\r
\r
**Example 2**：\r
\r
\r
**Input**：n = 3, start = 2\r
**Output**：[2,6,7,5,4,0,1,3]\r
**Explanation**：The binary representation of the permutation is (010,110,111,101,100,000,001,011).\r
\r
\r
\r
**Constraints**：\r
\r
\r
1 <= n $\le 16$\r
0 <= start < 2 ^ n\r
