## 题目

You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.

**Example 1**：


**Input**：times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
**Output**：2

**Example 2**：

**Input**：times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
**Output**：1

**Example 3**：

**Input**：times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
**Output**：-1


**Constraints**：

1 <= k <= n $\le 100$
1 $\le \mathrm{len}(times)$ $\le 6000$
times[i].length == 3
1 <= ui, vi <= n
ui != vi
0 <= wi $\le 100$
All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)
