## 题目

You are given a string compressed representing a compressed version of a string. The format is a character followed by its frequency. For example, "a3b1a1c2" is a compressed version of the string "aaabacc".
We seek a better compression with the following conditions:

Each character should appear only once in the compressed version.
The characters should be in alphabetical order.

Return the better compression of compressed.
Note: In the better version of compression, the order of letters may change, which is acceptable.

**Example 1**：

**Input**：compressed = "a3c9b2c1"
**Output**："a3b2c10"
**Explanation**：
Characters "a" and "b" appear only once in the input, but "c" appears twice, once with a size of 9 and once with a size of 1.
Hence, in the resulting string, it should have a size of 10.

**Example 2**：

**Input**：compressed = "c2b3a1"
**Output**："a1b3c2"

**Example 3**：

**Input**：compressed = "a2b4c1"
**Output**："a2b4c1"


**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(compressed)$ $\le 6$ * 104
compressed consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
compressed is a valid compression, i.e., each character is followed by its frequency.
Frequencies are in the range [1, 104] and have no leading zeroes.
