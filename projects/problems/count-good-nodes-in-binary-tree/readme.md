## 题目

Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.\r
\r
Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.\r
\r
\r
**Example 1**：\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
**Input**：root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]\r
**Output**：4\r
**Explanation**：Nodes in blue are good.\r
Root Node (3) is always a good node.\r
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.\r
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path\r
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.\r
\r
**Example 2**：\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
**Input**：root = [3,3,null,4,2]\r
**Output**：3\r
**Explanation**：Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.\r
\r
**Example 3**：\r
\r
\r
**Input**：root = [1]\r
**Output**：1\r
**Explanation**：Root is considered as good.\r
\r
\r
**Constraints**：\r
\r
\r
The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, $10^{5}$].\r
Each node's value is between [-$10^{4}$, $10^{4}$].\r
