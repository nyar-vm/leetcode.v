- **难度**：Easy
- **标签**：String

## 题目

You are given a binary string s consisting only of zeroes and ones.
A substring of s is considered balanced if all zeroes are before ones and the number of zeroes is equal to the number of ones inside the substring. Notice that the empty substring is considered a balanced substring.
Return the length of the longest balanced substring of s.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1**：

**Input**：s = "01000111"
**Output**：6
**Explanation**：The longest balanced substring is "000111", which has length 6.

**Example 2**：

**Input**：s = "00111"
**Output**：4
**Explanation**：The longest balanced substring is "0011", which has length 4.

**Example 3**：

**Input**：s = "111"
**Output**：0
**Explanation**：There is no balanced substring except the empty substring, so the answer is 0.


**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(s)$ $\le 50$
'0' <= s[i] <= '1'
