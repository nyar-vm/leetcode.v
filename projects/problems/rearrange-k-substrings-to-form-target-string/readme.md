## 题目

You are given two strings s and t, both of which are anagrams of each other, and an integer k.
Your task is to determine whether it is possible to split the string s into k equal-sized substrings, rearrange the substrings, and concatenate them in any order to create a new string that matches the given string t.
Return true if this is possible, otherwise, return false.
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1**：

**Input**：s = "abcd", t = "cdab", k = 2
**Output**：true
**Explanation**：

Split s into 2 substrings of length 2: ["ab", "cd"].
Rearranging these substrings as ["cd", "ab"], and then concatenating them results in "cdab", which matches t.


**Example 2**：

**Input**：s = "aabbcc", t = "bbaacc", k = 3
**Output**：true
**Explanation**：

Split s into 3 substrings of length 2: ["aa", "bb", "cc"].
Rearranging these substrings as ["bb", "aa", "cc"], and then concatenating them results in "bbaacc", which matches t.


**Example 3**：

**Input**：s = "aabbcc", t = "bbaacc", k = 2
**Output**：false
**Explanation**：

Split s into 2 substrings of length 3: ["aab", "bcc"].
These substrings cannot be rearranged to form t = "bbaacc", so the output is false.



**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(s)$ == t.length $\le 2$ * 105
1 <= k $\le \mathrm{len}(s)$
s.length is divisible by k.
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
The input is generated such that s and t are anagrams of each other.
