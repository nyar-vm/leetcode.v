## 题目

There are an infinite amount of bags on a number line, one bag for each coordinate. Some of these bags contain coins.
You are given a 2D array coins, where coins[i] = [li, ri, ci] denotes that every bag from li to ri contains ci coins.
The segments that coins contain are non-overlapping.
You are also given an integer k.
Return the maximum amount of coins you can obtain by collecting k consecutive bags.

**Example 1**：

**Input**：coins = [[8,10,1],[1,3,2],[5,6,4]], k = 4
**Output**：10
**Explanation**：
Selecting bags at positions [3, 4, 5, 6] gives the maximum number of coins: 2 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 10.

**Example 2**：

**Input**：coins = [[1,10,3]], k = 2
**Output**：6
**Explanation**：
Selecting bags at positions [1, 2] gives the maximum number of coins: 3 + 3 = 6.


**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(coins)$ $\le 105$
1 <= k $\le 109$
coins[i] == [li, ri, ci]
1 <= li <= ri $\le 109$
1 <= ci $\le 1000$
The given segments are non-overlapping.
