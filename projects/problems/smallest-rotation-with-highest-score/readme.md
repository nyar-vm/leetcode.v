## 题目

You are given an array nums. You can rotate it by a non-negative integer k so that the array becomes [nums[k], nums[k + 1], ... nums[nums.length - 1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]. Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth one point.

For example, if we have nums = [2,4,1,3,0], and we rotate by k = 2, it becomes [1,3,0,2,4]. This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 $\le 2$ [one point], 2 $\le 3$ [one point], 4 $\le 4$ [one point].

Return the rotation index k that corresponds to the highest score we can achieve if we rotated nums by it. If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index k.

**Example 1**：

**Input**：nums = [2,3,1,4,0]
**Output**：3
**Explanation**：Scores for each k are listed below:
k = 0,  nums = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2
k = 1,  nums = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3
k = 2,  nums = [1,4,0,2,3],    score 3
k = 3,  nums = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4
k = 4,  nums = [0,2,3,1,4],    score 3
So we should choose k = 3, which has the highest score.

**Example 2**：

**Input**：nums = [1,3,0,2,4]
**Output**：0
**Explanation**：nums will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.
So we will choose the smallest k, which is 0.


**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(nums)$ $\le 105$
0 <= nums[i] < nums.length
