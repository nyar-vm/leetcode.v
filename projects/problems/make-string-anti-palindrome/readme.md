## 题目

We call a string s of even length n an anti-palindrome if for each index 0 <= i < n, s[i] != s[n - i - 1].
Given a string s, your task is to make s an anti-palindrome by doing any number of operations (including zero).
In one operation, you can select two characters from s and swap them.
Return the resulting string. If multiple strings meet the conditions, return the lexicographically smallest one. If it can't be made into an anti-palindrome, return "-1".

**Example 1**：

**Input**：s = "abca"
**Output**："aabc"
**Explanation**：
"aabc" is an anti-palindrome string since s[0] != s[3] and s[1] != s[2]. Also, it is a rearrangement of "abca".

**Example 2**：

**Input**：s = "abba"
**Output**："aabb"
**Explanation**：
"aabb" is an anti-palindrome string since s[0] != s[3] and s[1] != s[2]. Also, it is a rearrangement of "abba".

**Example 3**：

**Input**：s = "cccd"
**Output**："-1"
**Explanation**：
You can see that no matter how you rearrange the characters of "cccd", either s[0] == s[3] or s[1] == s[2]. So it can not form an anti-palindrome string.


**Constraints**：

2 $\le \mathrm{len}(s)$ $\le 105$
s.length % 2 == 0
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
