## 题目

Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.
Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false otherwise.

**Example 1**：


**Input**：path = "NES"
**Output**：false
**Explanation**：Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.

**Example 2**：


**Input**：path = "NESWW"
**Output**：true
**Explanation**：Notice that the path visits the origin twice.

**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(path)$ $\le 104$
path[i] is either 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'.
