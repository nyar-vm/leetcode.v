## 题目

You are given a 2D array intervals, where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represents the start and the end of interval i. You are also given an integer k.
You must add exactly one new interval [startnew, endnew] to the array such that:

The length of the new interval, endnew - startnew, is at most k.
After adding, the number of connected groups in intervals is minimized.

A connected group of intervals is a maximal collection of intervals that, when considered together, cover a continuous range from the smallest point to the largest point with no gaps between them. Here are some examples:

A group of intervals [[1, 2], [2, 5], [3, 3]] is connected because together they cover the range from 1 to 5 without any gaps.
However, a group of intervals [[1, 2], [3, 4]] is not connected because the segment (2, 3) is not covered.

Return the minimum number of connected groups after adding exactly one new interval to the array.

**Example 1**：

**Input**：intervals = [[1,3],[5,6],[8,10]], k = 3
**Output**：2
**Explanation**：
After adding the interval [3, 5], we have two connected groups: [[1, 3], [3, 5], [5, 6]] and [[8, 10]].

**Example 2**：

**Input**：intervals = [[5,10],[1,1],[3,3]], k = 1
**Output**：3
**Explanation**：
After adding the interval [1, 1], we have three connected groups: [[1, 1], [1, 1]], [[3, 3]], and [[5, 10]].


**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(intervals)$ $\le 105$
intervals[i] == [starti, endi]
1 <= starti <= endi $\le 109$
1 <= k $\le 109$
