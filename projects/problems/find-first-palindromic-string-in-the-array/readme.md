## 题目

Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".
A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 1**：

**Input**：words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
**Output**："ada"
**Explanation**：The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.

**Example 2**：

**Input**：words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
**Output**："racecar"
**Explanation**：The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".

**Example 3**：

**Input**：words = ["def","ghi"]
**Output**：""
**Explanation**：There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.


**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(words)$ $\le 100$
1 <= words[i].length $\le 100$
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
