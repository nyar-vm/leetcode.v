## 题目

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

**Example 1**：

**Input**：nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
**Output**：[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
**Explanation**：
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

**Example 2**：

**Input**：nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
**Output**：[3,99,-1,-100]
**Explanation**：
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]


**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(nums)$ $\le 105$
-231 <= nums[i] $\le 231$ - 1
0 <= k $\le 105$
