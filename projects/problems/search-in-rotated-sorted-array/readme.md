## 题目

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with $O(\log n)$ runtime complexity.

**Example 1**：
**Input**：nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
**Output**：4
**Example 2**：
**Input**：nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
**Output**：-1
**Example 3**：
**Input**：nums = [1], target = 0
**Output**：-1


**Constraints**：

1 $\le \mathrm{len}(nums)$ $\le 5000$
-104 <= nums[i] $\le 104$
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-104 <= target $\le 104$
