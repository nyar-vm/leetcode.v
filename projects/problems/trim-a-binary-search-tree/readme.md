## 题目

Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.
Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

**Example 1**：


**Input**：root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
**Output**：[1,null,2]

**Example 2**：


**Input**：root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
**Output**：[3,2,null,1]


**Constraints**：

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
0 <= Node.val $\le 104$
The value of each node in the tree is unique.
root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
0 <= low <= high $\le 104$
